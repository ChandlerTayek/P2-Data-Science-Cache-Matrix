# Matrix Inverse in R

## About the project
This is a small exercise to investigate lexical scoping in R. This repo consists
of two functions that find and cache the inverse of a invertible matrix:
- makeCacheMatrix() 
- cacheSolve()


## About the class
This is a programming assignment from the Coursera course [R programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming).
The course was created by John Hopkins University and the course counts
as credit towards the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).
